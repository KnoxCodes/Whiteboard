## 🗂️ Description

The Whiteboard project is a digital drawing application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to create, edit, and manipulate visual content. This application is designed for individuals who need a simple and intuitive tool for drawing, annotating, and saving images. The Whiteboard application allows users to draw shapes, text, and lines, select and manipulate objects, pick colors, use an eraser, and save the canvas as an image.

The application is built using Python and leverages the Tkinter library for creating the GUI, along with PIL for image processing. The project aims to provide a straightforward and efficient digital whiteboard experience.
